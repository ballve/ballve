- 👋  
Hi, I’m @ballve
- 👀  
I’m interested in the future, the history of computing, and buying/keeping too many books
- 🌱  
I’m currently learning - math, how to fish/kayak, Git/GitHub, web design basics
- 💞️  
I’m looking to collaborate with a technical team, so I can help them gain more visibility for their project, up their authority, and more users/customers
- 📫  
How to reach me: Here is fine, but more immediate is my email, which is ballve@gmail.com, and I am also ballve on Twitter, etc.
